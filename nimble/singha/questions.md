## Initial questions

## super admin app
- documents verification flows


## Retail app

- shipping flows, ETA handling
- as a retailer what if I have multiple shops
- returning user - last order - wholesaler name (might have multiple ones)
- orders listing ui, what if we have more than one wholesaler?
- order detail ui status transitions what if we have more than one wholesaler?, items are not grouped by wholesaler
- delivery dispute might need wholesaler selection as well?
- loyalty points mechanics and redemption handling

## Wholesaler app

- is it only the web version? 
- inventory management - aren't locations needed?
